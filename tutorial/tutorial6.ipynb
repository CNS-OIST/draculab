    "### Units with multiport inputs and new requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "For some unit models, there may be several types of qualitatively different inputs. An example can be found in the `delta_linear` class of `custom_units.py`. This class, together with the `delta_synapse` class in in `synapses.py` implements a continuous-time version of the _delta_ learning rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _delta_ learning rule is one of the most widespread forms of supervised learning in neural networks. Given a _training set_ consisting of  input vectors \n",
    "$(\\bf{x_1}, \\dots, \\bf{x_n})$ and their corresponding desired outptus $(y_1, \\dots, y_n)$, the purpose of the delta rule is to adjust the input weights of a unit so\n",
    "the response to $\\bf{x_i}$ is $y_i$. Without going into details, this can sometimes be achieved by presenting the inputs one by one, each time adjusting the weights using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta \\omega_{j} = \\alpha (y - u)x_j$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y$ is the desired response to the input, $u$ is the actual response, $x_j$ is the $j$-th component of the input vector, $\\omega_j$ is the corresponding weight, and $\\alpha$ is a learning rate.  \n",
    "To implement this, we require to know not only the input to the unit, but also the desired output. Since the error $e \\equiv y - u$ is used by every synapse,\n",
    "it is computationally efficient to calculate it once in the unit class and make it available to all synapses. Thus, the error is a synaptic _requirement_ that must be updated at every simulation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is a guide to the source code in the `delta_linear`, and `delta_synapse` classes (found in `custom_units.py` and \n",
    "`synapses.py` respectively),\n",
    "which illustrate the tools used to create units with multiple input ports, and synapses that use custom requirements."

    "\n",
    "Another thing to observe is how the input ports of the \"xe\" connection are specified using a single list with `inp_dim` zeros and a `[1,2]` appended at the end. This is not a good general way to set the input ports, since it is harder to read, and the length of the list must match the number of connections being made, which is tricky when using random connectivity. In general, it is better to use `ei_network` when setting multiport connections, using separate layers for all the unit groups that target a specific port.\n",

    "Next, the ee connection is removed. The `ei_net.__init__` method has dictionaries for the connection and synapse specifications of the ee, ei, ie, ii, xe, and xi connections. By default, if the populations exist, these connections will be made. In our case the **i** population is absent, so ei, ie, ii, and xi will not appear. On the other hand, if we don't specify anything the ee connections will be made, in this case consisting of the delta unit connecting to itself. To avoid this we disallow autapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, notice that when configuring the delta unit we did not set the value of the `tau` parameter directly, but instead `tau_min` and `tau_wid`. The `tau` parameter of the units created by `ei_net.build` is set stochastically using a uniform distribution ranging from `tau_min` to `tau_min` + `tau_wid`. This approach is used for setting the `slope`, `thresh`, `tau`, and `init_val` parameters."
