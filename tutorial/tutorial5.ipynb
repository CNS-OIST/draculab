Switching the output value from $-1$ to $1$ (and viceversa) will happen gradually, with a time constant $\\tau$, and the unit will approach its end values asymptotically.

    "* the `derivatives` method is used by `unit.update`, whereas `unit.flat_update` calls `dt_fun`. It is not necessary to write both methods, but adding them both allows our unit to work in simulations with regular and flat networks.\n",
    "* The `get_input_sum` method is a utility provided by the `unit` class. It returns the sum of all the inputs received by the unit at a given time, each input multiplied by its corresponding synaptic weight. Moreover, all the inputs are obtained considering their corresponding delays. Other methods provided by the unit class are `get_inputs`, and `get_weights`. These can be used to make the `derivatives` function easier to write and read.\n",
    "* When the network is flat, the unit will have an `inp_sum` attribute, which provides the scaled sum of inputs at various points in time. `inp_sum[0]` is the input sum at the beginning of the current simulation step. `inp_sum[1]` is the input sum at `min_delay/min_buff_size` time units later, and so forth. Unless we're writing a new integration it is not necessary to understand these details. What's important is to know that `imp_sum[s]` is the input. If for some reason the \"raw\" inputs are required, these are in the `unit.step_inps` array (see `unit.upd_flat_inp_sum`).\n",

    "### Creating a new synapse type\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's assume that we want to create a new type of synapse. This synapse will have a weight that will adopt one of two values, -1 or 1 (clearly not biologically realistic). Let $\\langle x_{pre} \\rangle$ be the average value of the presynaptic activity, and $\\langle x_{post} \\rangle$ be the average postsynaptic activity. Our synapse will be such that the weigth will move to 1 if $\\langle x_{pre} \\rangle > \\langle x_{post} \\rangle$, and to -1 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed to write the synapse class, we should specify how the average activity is calculated. The average of a continuous function $f$ is usually defined as\n",
    "$ \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{t_0}^{t_0 + T} f(s) ds $. Using this type of average for our rule, however, is not very practical; the reason is that it gives the same importance to values that occurred in the distant past compared to recent values. After a while, the values of the average become slower, and slower to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to obtain an average that places more importance on the most recent values is to use a first order *low-pass filter*. A simple, yet effective version is defined by:\n",
    "$\\frac{d \\langle x \\rangle}{dt} = \\frac{ x - \\langle x \\rangle }{ \\tau_f } $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a quantity can be calculated by the unit and made available to all its synapses if the unit contains a low-pass filter *requirement*. In general, a requirement can be added to a unit if the requirement's name is added to `syn_needs`, which is an object of the *set* data type in the unit. This can be done in the unit's constructor. The name of all available requirements can be seen in the `syn_reqs` enum class of `draculab.py`. Alternatively, they are displayed by the command `syn_reqs.list_names()`. Documentation about a particular requirement can be found in the methods of the `requirements.py` file at the `requirements` folder; in particular, in the methods called `add_<requirement name>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of requirements used by synapses, it is not necessary to add them in the constructors of the units we'll use. If we specify which requirements will be used by the synapse in its constructor, these will be automatically added to the relevant units by `network.connect`. The code in this example will illustrate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to the case of units, to create the new synapse type we will follow 3 steps:\n",
    "1. Register the name of the synapse in the synapse_types enum at `draculab.py`. This is basically the same as the first step to create a new unit type.\n",
    "2. Create the synapse class, with an `__init__` method.\n",
    "3. Write the function that the synapse uses to update its weight in the `update` method. This method is called every `min_delay` time units during the simulation.\n",

There are 3 filter *requirements* available, (`lpf_fast`, `lpf_mid`, and `lpf_slow`), and their names are supposed to help keep track of how fast they are compared to each other.\n",

This is also a mid-speed low-pass filter, but whereas `lpf_mid` creates the requirement in the postsynaptic unit, `pre_lpf_mid` creates it in the presynaptic unit. In this way we can have a correlational learning rule that uses averaged activities from pre- and post-synaptic units.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `update` method is rather straightforward, except for the `get_lpf_mid` functions. These are _getter_ functions for the `lpf_mid` value in a unit. Getter functions are often recommended for object-oriented programming, but they are not important in Python. In general, requirements don't need a getter function; there is a variable in the unit whose name matches the requirement name, and it can directly be retrived (e.g. `value = unit.lpf_mid`). In the case of the LPF requirements, however, it is important to have a getter function because we want to retrieve *past* values of the requirement. Since there is a transmission delay, the average value of the *presynaptic* unit is know with that delay. The synapse stores this delay in the `delay_steps` variable, using \"time step\" time units, where a time step has a `min_delay` duration. The function `get_lpf_mid(n)` returns the value of `lpf_mid` as it was `n` time steps ago. For the postsynaptic unit, where the synapse is supposed to be located, this value is known instantaneously, but for the presynaptic unit it is know after a delay.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this exercise you'll be asked to write the `point_mass_2D.__init__` method. The solution of the exercise is, of course, the source code in `plants.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of freedom regarding the data that you can put into a plant object, but there are 3 attributes that are mandatory in the parameters dictionary given to the `plant` constructor: the `type` of the plant, the `dimension` of the plant's ODE model, and the input dimensionality (`inp_dim`). The `dimension` and `inp_dim` attributes are not something that the user should specify in the parameter dictionary, since these are fixed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that the `__init__` method of `point_mass_2D` does is to fix the values of `dimension` and `inp_dim`.  \n",
    "Then it calls its parent constructor.  \n",
    "Next it sets the value of the `init_state` vector, which is a Numpy 1D array with the initial values of the state variables.  \n",
    "Finally, the `buffer` array is created. This is a 2D Numpy array. Its number of rows is the `buff_width` variable set by the parent constructor, and each row is a copy of the `init_state` vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise is to write the `__init__` method, with the steps outlined above, and the initialization of any other required attributes."

    "You should be able to observe a small difference at latter times in the simulation. Since no integration method was specified in the parameters of the binary unit, `odeint` is used by default. This integratator uses adaptive steps size and automatically switches between methods in order to achieve a desired accuracy. For details, se the notes on the \"lsoda\" integrator [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.ode.html#scipy.integrate.ode). In our case, the accuracy of integration used by `odeint` is set by the network parameters `atol` and `rtol`. These two were not explicitly written in the `net_params` dictionary, so they adopted their default $10^{-6}$ value, which is very precise (and relatively slow).\n",

    "On the other hand, when this tutorial was written, draculab would by default use a forward Euler integrator when `flat_run` was called. The forward Euler method has an error that depends linearly on the step size. Despite its simplicity and speed it can be very inaccurate, and even unstable for certain ODE systems. Therefore, in a simulation with the forward Euler solver it is important to be aware of that the step size is `min_delay`/`min_buff_size`, and that it is good practice to corroborate results using smaller step sizes, or a different solver.\n",

    "In the case of the synapse, its `update` method is in effect a forward Euler solver. This is acceptable when the synapse changes slowly compared to the `min_delay` value. If there was a case where this wasn't true, the synapse would need a more accurate integration method in its `update` function."
