sirasy.py is a Python module containing classes to simulate
networks of rate units with delayed connections.

The simulator is expected to be simple and compact enough that 
any experienced Python user can understand its source code
and make any required adjustments.

A basic usage example is in the Jupyter notebook test1.ipynb .
